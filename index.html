        Minecraft's new frogs were briefly swallowing goats whole

      <p class="newsBody">
        As part of the experimental features in Minecraft Bedrock version
        1.18.10, Mojang has revealed some of the abilities of the frog mobs
        coming in this year's Wild Update. They can eat small Slimes and small
        Magma Cubes, which is a goofy enough habit. As Mojang shared during
        today's Minecraft Live presentation, frogs had a brief period as apex
        predators capable of swallowing entire goats. Players started noticing
        this savage frog behavior in the beta version of Minecraft for Windows
        back in January. Their hunger was, as some players realized, insatiable.
